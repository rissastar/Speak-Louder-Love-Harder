      <h1>What is Cystic Fibrosis?</h1>
      <p>
        Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. It primarily affects the lungs and digestive system due to a defect in the CFTR gene, which regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells.

<button class="collapsible">My Story with Cystic Fibrosis</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p> It started with sickness‚Äîbut it became survival. </p>
      <p> I was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis at seven years old, but deep down, I always knew something wasn‚Äôt right. My stomach was constantly in knots. I couldn‚Äôt gain weight no matter what I ate. I was tiny, tired, and always bloated. Going to the bathroom was a daily battle. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to run and play like the other kids. While they were outside being carefree, I was inside with a book or writing‚Äîtrying to distract myself from how awful I felt. </p>
      <p> When I was finally diagnosed, I ended up in the hospital for nearly two months. At seven years old, that felt like a lifetime. Everything changed overnight. I went from being the ‚Äúmystery sick kid‚Äù to being told I had a disease I‚Äôd live with for the rest of my life. I didn‚Äôt fully understand it‚Äîall I knew was that I had to take a bunch of pills, start physiotherapy, and do something called ‚Äúchest therapy‚Äù to help clear my lungs. It was overwhelming. And terrifying. </p>
      <p> At first, my parents tried to help. But like a lot of things, that faded. Eventually, the responsibility of managing my medications and treatments fell on me‚Äîeven though I was still just a child. I got in trouble for missing treatments, but I was rarely reminded or taught how to build a routine. I felt more like a burden than anything else. </p>
      <p> After I left the hospital, life didn‚Äôt go back to normal. Instead, it became a revolving door of appointments, checkups, and endless tests. I spent a lot of time at the IWK‚Äîthe children‚Äôs hospital in Halifax. That place became a huge part of my life. I had clinic visits every three months, sometimes more. Each visit was a full day: bloodwork, lung function tests, X-rays, dietitians, doctors, pharmacists. It was exhausting. I was constantly being poked, prodded, and told to eat more, gain weight, take more pills, do more treatments. It never stopped. </p>
      <p> I remember being so young, sitting in those waiting rooms, watching other kids with different conditions, thinking, Is this my life now? I felt trapped in a body that wouldn‚Äôt work the way it should. Some days, it felt like I was being punished just for existing. </p>
      <p> As I got older, the hospital became my second home‚Äîespecially around age 16, when I started getting really sick again. My hospital stays became more frequent‚Äîeventually almost monthly. I‚Äôd be admitted for IV antibiotics, round-the-clock physiotherapy, and close monitoring. Each time, I had to fight to regain the strength I‚Äôd lost. It felt like taking one step forward, ten steps back. </p>
      <p> And CF isn‚Äôt just physical‚Äîit hits your mental health hard. The isolation. The pressure. The constant fear of what could go wrong. It builds up. I was dealing with way more than any kid or teenager should have to, and there was very little emotional support. </p>
      <p> But through all of it, there were moments of strength. CF taught me how to be tough‚Äîeven when I didn‚Äôt want to be. It taught me to listen to my body and stand up for myself. I didn‚Äôt have the luxury of staying a kid for long. I had to grow up fast. </p>
      <p> Things changed in December 2021 when I started Trikafta. It was like someone finally turned the lights back on. I could breathe again. I wasn‚Äôt getting sick as often. I had energy. For the first time in years, I felt like I had some control over my health. But I‚Äôll never forget everything that came before‚Äîthe hospital stays, the pain, the fear, and the constant fight. </p>
      <p> Cystic Fibrosis has taken a lot from me‚Äîmy childhood, my sense of safety, my ability to just be a kid. But it also shaped me. I‚Äôm strong because I had no other choice. I‚Äôm still here. Still breathing. Still fighting. And I‚Äôm damn proud of that. </p>
