      <h3>🌱 Jess, 24 (Opioid Recovery)</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “I didn’t think I’d live past 21. I lost friends, I lost time. But one day, someone didn’t give up on me. And that changed everything. I still fight cravings, but I’m three years clean now.”

      <h3>🧠 Marcus, 38 (Alcohol & Depression)</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “I thought drinking helped me cope. It numbed the pain. But in therapy I learned the pain needed to be heard, not silenced. Recovery didn’t ‘fix me’—it gave me tools to be human again.”

      <h3>🌀 Kai, 19 (Internet & Binge Addiction)</h3>
      <blockquote>
        “My addiction wasn’t to a substance, it was to escape. I lived online to avoid reality. I had to learn balance, boundaries, and most of all—to ask for help.”
