      <h2>What Is Sexual Assault?</h2>
      <p>
        Sexual assault is any sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent. It can include unwanted touching, fondling, coercion, rape, or attempted rape. It's about power, not passion, and it‚Äôs never the survivor‚Äôs fault.

      <h2>Signs & Myths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> If you didn't say "no" out loud, it wasn't assault.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Consent must be clear, enthusiastic, and ongoing. Silence does not equal consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> It only counts if it was violent.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Many survivors freeze, dissociate, or comply out of fear. Lack of resistance does not mean permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Only strangers assault people.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Most survivors know the person who hurt them.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> If you're not physically hurt, it's not serious.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> The emotional trauma can be lifelong, even if there are no visible injuries.</li>

      <h2>My Story ‚Äì Larissa</h2>
      <p><strong>Trigger Warning: This story includes real experiences of sexual assault and may be difficult for some readers.</strong></p>
      <p>
        When I was a kid, my brother and I spent time at our neighbor‚Äôs house ‚Äî a place filled with fun and comfort, or so it seemed. They took us on trips, gave us gifts, and treated us like family. But underneath that kindness was something darker.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a trip to Vancouver, I was separated from my brother. In the hotel, the woman encouraged me to go down a waterslide with the man ‚Äúso he‚Äôd get hard.‚Äù I froze. Later that night, I had what felt like a nightmare ‚Äî his breath, his weight, the paralysis. It felt real. My therapist later said it sounded like I had been drugged.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe I was raped. I believe it happened more than once. And no one protected us ‚Äî not even my mother. She made me apologize and sent us back to their house. But my Nan believed me. She called the police. I tried to speak, but the justice system let it go. Still, I remember. I always will.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were other red flags. I was too young to bleed. I was told it was nothing. I was not believed. But I survived. This is my story. It‚Äôs raw. It‚Äôs real. And I‚Äôm done being silent.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If you‚Äôve been through something like this:</strong><br>
      You are not imagining things. You are allowed to speak. You deserve to be heard. You deserve healing and peace.

      <h2>Another Experience</h2>
      <p>
        When I was younger and living in Dartmouth, there was a boy I had a crush on. One day, while hanging out with him, his friend started touching me in ways that made me very uncomfortable. I pulled his hands away, told him to stop ‚Äî but he didn‚Äôt at first. I was scared. Eventually, it ended, and I left.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened again, at a different guy‚Äôs house ‚Äî same situation. But that time, the boy I liked told his friend to stop. That was the only reason it ended. These moments left me confused, hurt, and unsure how to process what had happened. But even then, I knew: I deserved better.
