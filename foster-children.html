      <h2>My Story: Life in Foster Care</h2>
      <p>
        Being taken into care isn’t something you forget. One minute you’re a kid trying to hold your world together, and the next, strangers show up and decide your life for you. That’s what it felt like. No explanation that made sense, no comfort. Just gone. I was only 11 when they took me and my brother Keegan for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were placed in foster care for 22 days, and honestly, it was terrifying. I didn’t feel safe. I didn’t feel seen. Thankfully, our Nan stepped up and got custody of us. Living with Nanny Cindy was the first time I felt like someone really cared. She asked if I took my CF pills, if I did my treatments—she gave a damn. That was everything to me. I didn’t have to carry it all alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But things never stayed steady for long. Keegan said our Nan was treating him badly—he felt unheard and acted out. I tried to stand up for him, being his sister and all. But that choice came with a price. They took us away from her too. From that point, everything spiraled.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved 11 times in one single year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time, I was expected to settle in, act normal, pretend I was okay. But I wasn’t. I was hurt. I was confused. I was a kid just trying to find some ground to stand on. One time, the foster family I was staying with decided to go on vacation—and instead of finding a safe, stable place for me, they dropped me off at a new foster home in the middle of nowhere. Like I was just an afterthought. That moment broke me a little more. I didn’t feel like a person—I felt like a problem nobody wanted to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, Keegan and I ended up with our mom’s dad and his girlfriend. The judge made them our guardians. They were told not to smoke or drink around us, especially with me having Cystic Fibrosis. But they didn’t care. They smoked inside. I remember coughing until I collapsed on the kitchen floor. I was begging for help—texting my worker, Caroline, over and over again. She never replied. No one was listening. And when you’re a kid screaming into silence… it changes you.
      </p>
      <p>
        At one point, we were put with a family that said they were going to adopt us. I thought maybe this is it. Maybe I’ll finally have a real home. But it didn’t feel like love. It felt like we were trophies. Something to “save” so they could feel good about themselves. I didn’t feel chosen—I felt trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before them, I lived with my father’s parents. And honestly? I didn’t feel like I belonged anywhere by that point. My dad never even tried to get us. He knew we were in care. He knew what we were going through. He still didn’t bother. That kind of rejection stays with you. It made me feel like I wasn’t worth fighting for. Like I was too broken for anyone to want.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yeah, I was a troubled kid. But how could I not be? I was just trying to survive all the places, all the people, all the chaos. I didn’t need punishment—I needed love. I didn’t need another house—I needed a home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up running away—more than once. It wasn’t because I was bad. It was because no one was listening. The only person who really heard me at the time was my counselor at the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic. Everyone else? They judged, assumed, or ignored. And it broke something inside me.
      </p>
      <p>
        All I ever wanted was to be with my mom—or back with Nanny Cindy. Somewhere that actually felt like love. Somewhere I could just breathe and be a kid.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If You’re a Foster Kid Reading This:</strong></p>
      <p>
        You are not the system’s label. You are not what happened to you. And you are not alone. I see you, I hear you—and I’m still here too.
