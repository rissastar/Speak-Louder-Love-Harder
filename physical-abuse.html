      <h2>What is Physical Abuse?</h2>
      <p>
        Physical abuse is any intentional act causing injury or trauma to another person by way of bodily contact. It includes hitting, punching, slapping, choking, pushing, or other forms of violent physical force. It's often used to exert power or control, and it can happen in any type of relationship.

      <h2>My Story with Physical Abuse and Toxic Relationships</h2>
      <p>
        Physical abuse is often misunderstood as just bruises and broken skin, but for me, it was much more than that. It was a deep, searing fear that crept into every part of my life, reshaping how I saw myself, the people around me, and what I thought I deserved.
      </p>

      <h3>Abuse Within My Family</h3>
      <p>
        The abuse I experienced growing up came from family — people I believed would protect me. Instead, they caused wounds deeper than bruises. Home wasn’t a refuge; it was a cage. Survival meant silence. I learned to hide pain and question my worth.
      </p>

      <h3>Abuse in Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        One night in a hotel, a man I barely knew beat me so severely I ended up with two black eyes and bruises all over. I thought I might die. Another time, a boyfriend took me to New Brunswick — but instead of escaping, I became more isolated. That relationship was another prison. Abuse doesn’t end just because the scenery changes.
      </p>

      <h3>The Toll and the Truth</h3>
      <p>
        Physical abuse changed everything: my confidence, my ability to trust, my sense of self. But even through that pain — I survived. I’m still healing. And I’m reclaiming my voice, one word at a time.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Want You to Know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You are not alone.</li>
        <li>You are not to blame.</li>
        <li>You deserve safety, peace, and love.</li>
        <li>Your fear is valid. Your story matters. Your healing is possible.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section dark">
      <h2>Myths vs. Truths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> If it was really bad, you'd leave. <br><strong>Truth:</strong> Leaving can be dangerous and complicated.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Only women experience physical abuse. <br><strong>Truth:</strong> Anyone can be a victim — any gender, age, or background.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> It’s not abuse if you weren’t seriously injured. <br><strong>Truth:</strong> All abuse is serious. Every act matters.</li>
