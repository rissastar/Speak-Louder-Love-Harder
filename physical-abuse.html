      <h2>What is Physical Abuse?</h2>
      <p>
        Physical abuse is any intentional act causing injury or trauma to another person by way of bodily contact. It includes hitting, punching, slapping, choking, pushing, or other forms of violent physical force. It's often used to exert power or control, and it can happen in any type of relationship.

<div class="content">
      <p>
        Physical abuse is often misunderstood as just bruises and broken skin, but for me, it was much more than that. It was a deep, searing fear that crept into every part of my life, reshaping how I saw myself, the people around me, and what I thought I deserved.
      </p>

      <h3>Abuse Within My Family</h3>
      <p>
        The abuse I experienced growing up came from family ‚Äî people I believed would protect me. Instead, they caused wounds deeper than bruises. Home wasn‚Äôt a refuge; it was a cage. Survival meant silence. I learned to hide pain and question my worth.
      </p>

      <h3>Abuse in Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        One night in a hotel, a man I barely knew beat me so severely I ended up with two black eyes and bruises all over. I thought I might die. Another time, a boyfriend took me to New Brunswick ‚Äî but instead of escaping, I became more isolated. That relationship was another prison. Abuse doesn‚Äôt end just because the scenery changes.
      </p>

      <h3>The Toll and the Truth</h3>
      <p>
        Physical abuse changed everything: my confidence, my ability to trust, my sense of self. But even through that pain ‚Äî I survived. I‚Äôm still healing. And I‚Äôm reclaiming my voice, one word at a time.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Want You to Know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You are not alone.</li>
        <li>You are not to blame.</li>
        <li>You deserve safety, peace, and love.</li>
        <li>Your fear is valid. Your story matters. Your healing is possible.</li>
      </ul>
