  <h1>My Story with Physical Abuse and Toxic Relationships</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Physical abuse is often misunderstood as just bruises and broken skin, but for me, it was much more than that. It was a deep, searing fear that crept into every part of my life, reshaping how I saw myself, the people around me, and what I thought I deserved. The people who hurt me most were the ones I should have been able to trust — family members who were supposed to protect me, and partners who were supposed to love me.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Abuse Within My Family</h2>
    <p>The abuse I experienced growing up came from family — the people I believed would be my safe haven. Instead, they caused wounds deeper than the physical marks. These moments left me scared of the place I called home, a place that should have been a refuge but instead felt like a cage.</p>
    <p>The pain wasn’t just in my body; it was in the betrayal and confusion. I learned early that survival meant silence — not speaking up because the consequences felt worse than the pain itself.</p>
    <p>Living in that environment taught me to mask my suffering, to pretend everything was okay when it wasn’t. It made me question my worth and my right to safety and love.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Abuse in Relationships</h2>
    <p>The physical abuse I endured in relationships added layers of fear and trauma that I’m still unpacking. One night at a hotel stands out — a night when a man I only talked to, never even dated, beat me so severely that I ended up with two black eyes and bruises all over my body. I was so terrified I genuinely thought I might die. That night shattered my sense of security and trust in people.</p>
    <p>The bruises eventually faded, but the terror stayed. I found myself constantly questioning everything: Was it my fault? Did I say or do something to deserve this? Why did someone I trusted hurt me so badly?</p>
    <p>Physical abuse wasn’t the only thing I faced. The fear of the next attack, the emotional trauma, and the feeling of being trapped in a nightmare became constant shadows over my life.</p>
    <p>Then, there was the time when another boyfriend took me to New Brunswick with him. I hoped it would be a fresh start, a way to escape the pain and chaos. But instead, it became another prison.</p>
    <p>The distance from home, from friends and familiar faces, made me feel even more isolated. I was with someone physically, but emotionally I was trapped — stuck in a cycle of fear and loneliness. The abuse didn’t stop just because we changed locations; it followed me everywhere, eroding my spirit and hope.</p>

    <h2>The Emotional Toll and Impact</h2>
    <p>Physical abuse changes you. It damages your trust in others and in yourself. It leaves scars that no one else can see — scars of anxiety, fear, and self-doubt. I built walls around my heart to protect myself from more pain, but sometimes those walls felt like prisons I couldn’t escape.</p>
    <p>It’s hard to explain how it feels to live in fear of someone who’s supposed to care for you. To constantly question your own reality. To lose pieces of yourself because you think that’s the price you have to pay to survive.</p>
    <p>But through all of it, I found strength I didn’t know I had. I survived. I kept fighting for myself even when I felt broken. And every day, I choose to reclaim my life, my voice, and my power.</p>

    <h2>What I Want You to Know</h2>
    <blockquote>

        <li>You deserve to be safe, to be loved, and to live without fear.</li>
        <li>It’s okay to ask for help.</li>

    <p>Physical abuse tries to steal your power, but your power is still inside you — waiting to be claimed. You are worthy of healing, peace, and love. You are worthy of freedom.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Physical Abuse</h2>
    <p>Physical abuse involves the use of physical force against someone in a way that injures or endangers that person. It can include hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, burning, or any other physical harm.</p>
    <p>It's important to recognize that physical abuse is not limited to visible injuries. The emotional and psychological impact can be profound and long-lasting.</p>
