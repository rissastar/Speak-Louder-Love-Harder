    <summary><strong>My Story</strong></summary>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>Mental health is something I used to ignore—or honestly, just survive through. Growing up with Cystic Fibrosis meant the focus was always on my body, not my mind. But the truth is, the emotional pain I’ve carried has been just as heavy—maybe even heavier—than the physical.</p>
      <p>Even before I was taken away from my mom, I remember feeling sad all the time. When I was 10 years old, I wrote in my journal: “I think I’m depressed. I cry myself to sleep every night.” Those feelings weren’t new—they were already inside me, growing and shaping who I was.</p>
      <p>I was always scared—scared of being hurt, scared of being kidnapped or killed. I’m still not sure if those fears came from things I experienced or just from the world feeling so unsafe. But they were real. They made me feel small and trapped. I also remember watching my mom go downhill—knowing something was wrong but not knowing how to help her or even talk about it.</p>
      <p>After being taken away from my mom, I was forced to talk to a therapist by court order. I didn’t feel safe or ready, and therapy felt more like a punishment than a place of healing. I didn’t know how to open up, and I carried that fear and mistrust with me for years.</p>
      <p>Around age 14, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and placed on medication. Finding something that actually helped was a frustrating journey. I went through multiple medications before finally finding Olanzapine, which stabilized some of the chaos in my head—but it left me feeling sedated and disconnected. I had to come off it. That just added to the cycle: feeling broken, trying to get better, then feeling broken all over again.</p>
      <p>For years, I was in and out of hospitals—struggling with deep depression, suicidal thoughts, and emotional breakdowns. I wanted help. I just didn’t know how to let it in. And truthfully, I didn’t feel like I deserved it.</p>
      <p>One of the scariest parts of living with mental illness for me has been the memory loss. There are chunks of my childhood I can’t remember at all—whole years that feel foggy or completely gone. It’s like my brain blacked out pieces to protect me. Trauma does that—it hides the memories too painful to process.</p>
      <p>I’ve lived in survival mode for so long that it became my default setting. I overreact to things I know shouldn’t bother me, but my body doesn’t care. My heart races, my hands shake, my mind panics—and I either want to run, shut down completely, or lash out emotionally. It’s not something I choose. It’s my brain trying to protect me, even when the danger isn’t real anymore.</p>
      <p>I’ve always had a fear of dying. Not just the act of dying—but the blackness, the nothingness that might come after. I used to lie awake at night, terrified of the thought that I might disappear and no one would remember me.</p>
      <p>And then there’s my empathy—this thing that lets me feel so deeply, sometimes it breaks me. I carry emotions that don’t even belong to me because I can’t stand the idea of someone else suffering. But it also means I break down easily. That I care so much, it sometimes destroys me.</p>
      <p>The loneliness that comes with all of this is intense. I’ve withdrawn from friends and family—not because I don’t love them, but because I feel like I’m drowning and I don’t want to drag anyone down with me. The uncontrollable thoughts, the self-hate, the fear, the flashbacks—it all builds up inside.</p>
      <p>I’ve survived sexual assault, emotional abuse, neglect, abandonment. I’ve been bullied, degraded, broken down—by people who should have loved me, and by people I trusted. That kind of damage doesn’t go away overnight.</p>
      <p>School was hell. I was bullied for my looks, for being different, for being a foster kid. They made fun of my real family—said cruel things about why we were taken. I already hated myself, and the bullying just confirmed what I believed: that I was nothing. That I didn’t belong.</p>
      <p><strong>And yet—somehow—I’m still here.</strong></p>
      <p>I’m in therapy again. Real therapy. I’m working with a psychiatrist, trying DBT, reading about BPD and CBT. I’m trying—even on days it feels impossible. I fight. I write. I get out of bed. I take care of Zayah.</p>
      <p>I’ve realized I can’t do this alone. I need people who are patient, who listen, who care. Anyone who can’t show up with empathy will be left behind.</p>
      <p>I don’t want to feel this way forever. I want peace. I want clarity. I want freedom—from trauma, shame, fear. I want to be loved the way I love. I want to be remembered. I want to matter.</p>
      <p><strong>I am not who I was a year ago. I’ve grown through unimaginable pain. And I’m still becoming someone stronger, wiser, and more me than I’ve ever been before. 🫶🏻</strong></p>
