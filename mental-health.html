        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <p>Mental health is something I used to ignore‚Äîor honestly, just survive through. Growing up with Cystic Fibrosis meant the focus was always on my body, not my mind. But the truth is, the emotional pain I‚Äôve carried has been just as heavy‚Äîmaybe even heavier‚Äîthan the physical.</p>
          <p>Even before I was taken away from my mom, I remember feeling sad all the time. When I was 10 years old, I wrote in my journal: ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm depressed. I cry myself to sleep every night.‚Äù Those feelings weren‚Äôt new‚Äîthey were already inside me, growing and shaping who I was.</p>
          <p>I was always scared‚Äîscared of being hurt, scared of being kidnapped or killed. I‚Äôm still not sure if those fears came from things I experienced or just from the world feeling so unsafe. But they were real. They made me feel small and trapped. I also remember watching my mom go downhill‚Äîknowing something was wrong but not knowing how to help her or even talk about it.</p>
          <p>After being taken away from my mom, I was forced to talk to a therapist by court order. I didn‚Äôt feel safe or ready, and therapy felt more like a punishment than a place of healing. I didn‚Äôt know how to open up, and I carried that fear and mistrust with me for years.</p>
          <p>Around age 14, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and placed on medication. Finding something that actually helped was a frustrating journey. I went through multiple medications before finally finding Olanzapine, which stabilized some of the chaos in my head‚Äîbut it left me feeling sedated and disconnected. I had to come off it. That just added to the cycle: feeling broken, trying to get better, then feeling broken all over again.</p>
          <p>For years, I was in and out of hospitals‚Äîstruggling with deep depression, suicidal thoughts, and emotional breakdowns. I wanted help. I just didn‚Äôt know how to let it in. And truthfully, I didn‚Äôt feel like I deserved it.</p>
          <p>One of the scariest parts of living with mental illness for me has been the memory loss. There are chunks of my childhood I can‚Äôt remember at all‚Äîwhole years that feel foggy or completely gone. It‚Äôs like my brain blacked out pieces to protect me. Trauma does that‚Äîit hides the memories too painful to process.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôve lived in survival mode for so long that it became my default setting. I overreact to things I know shouldn‚Äôt bother me, but my body doesn‚Äôt care. My heart races, my hands shake, my mind panics‚Äîand I either want to run, shut down completely, or lash out emotionally. It‚Äôs not something I choose. It‚Äôs my brain trying to protect me, even when the danger isn‚Äôt real anymore.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôve always had a fear of dying. Not just the act of dying‚Äîbut the blackness, the nothingness that might come after. I used to lie awake at night, terrified of the thought that I might disappear and no one would remember me.</p>
          <p>And then there‚Äôs my empathy‚Äîthis thing that lets me feel so deeply, sometimes it breaks me. I carry emotions that don‚Äôt even belong to me because I can‚Äôt stand the idea of someone else suffering. But it also means I break down easily. That I care so much, it sometimes destroys me.</p>
          <p>The loneliness that comes with all of this is intense. I‚Äôve withdrawn from friends and family‚Äînot because I don‚Äôt love them, but because I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and I don‚Äôt want to drag anyone down with me. The uncontrollable thoughts, the self-hate, the fear, the flashbacks‚Äîit all builds up inside.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôve survived sexual assault, emotional abuse, neglect, abandonment. I‚Äôve been bullied, degraded, broken down‚Äîby people who should have loved me, and by people I trusted. That kind of damage doesn‚Äôt go away overnight.</p>
          <p>School was hell. I was bullied for my looks, for being different, for being a foster kid. They made fun of my real family‚Äîsaid cruel things about why we were taken. I already hated myself, and the bullying just confirmed what I believed: that I was nothing. That I didn‚Äôt belong.</p>
          <p><strong>And yet‚Äîsomehow‚ÄîI‚Äôm still here.</strong></p>
          <p>I‚Äôm in therapy again. Real therapy. I‚Äôm working with a psychiatrist, trying DBT, reading about BPD and CBT. I‚Äôm trying‚Äîeven on days it feels impossible. I fight. I write. I get out of bed. I take care of Zayah.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôve realized I can‚Äôt do this alone. I need people who are patient, who listen, who care without judgment. I want to be a voice for others who feel invisible or broken. Because if I can survive all this, maybe they can too.</p>
