    <h2>What Is Emotional Abuse?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional or psychological abuse involves patterns of behavior that harm a person's emotional well-being or sense of self-worth. It can include manipulation, gaslighting, threats, constant criticism, isolation, and other controlling behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike physical abuse, emotional abuse can be subtle and long-lasting‚Äîoften making survivors question whether what they‚Äôre experiencing is ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù to count. But it is. Abuse is abuse.

<button class="collapsible">My Experience with Emotional Abuse</button>
<div class="content">
      <p><strong>Emotional abuse doesn‚Äôt always leave visible scars ‚Äî but it leaves lasting damage.</strong> It reshapes how you see yourself, how you trust others, and how safe you feel in your own skin.</p>

      <p><strong>From Family</strong><br>
      It started early. My own family taught me to hide my emotions, to be the strong one, to stay quiet even when I was hurting. When I expressed pain, I was ‚Äútoo sensitive.‚Äù When I had needs, I was ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù I was made to feel like a burden ‚Äî like I had to earn love, and even then, it could be taken away at any moment.</p>

      <p><strong>From Bullies</strong><br>
      School wasn‚Äôt safe either. I was picked apart by bullies who saw my differences and used them as ammo. They mocked my health, my past, my appearance ‚Äî anything they could. Those voices followed me long after school ended. And the worst part? Eventually, I started believing them.</p>

      <p><strong>From Relationships</strong><br>
      In my relationships, the abuse wore a different mask. It looked like love at first. Then it looked like control, jealousy, manipulation. I was told what I could wear. I was kept from friends. I was gaslit until I questioned my own reality. I was made to feel crazy for needing support.</p>

      <p>Some of them sexualized me in humiliating ways ‚Äî accusing me of things I hadn‚Äôt done, twisting innocent moments. I felt violated without ever being touched. I lost my sense of safety in my own body.</p>

      <p><strong>But I‚Äôm Still Here</strong><br>
      Emotional abuse doesn‚Äôt end when the person walks away. It echoes. It sticks. But so does healing. I‚Äôve had to unlearn everything I was taught about love and worth. I‚Äôve had to relearn how to trust myself, how to speak up, and how to believe that I deserve more.</p>

      <p>If you‚Äôre in it ‚Äî if you‚Äôve been hurt by family, bullied in school, or broken down in a relationship ‚Äî I want you to know:<br>
      It‚Äôs not your fault. You are not ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù You are enough. And what happened to you was abuse, even if no one ever hit you.</p>

      <p>You deserve to be safe. You deserve to be heard. And you deserve to heal on your own terms.</p>
