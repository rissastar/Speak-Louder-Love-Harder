    <h2>What Is Emotional Abuse?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional or psychological abuse involves patterns of behavior that harm a person's emotional well-being or sense of self-worth. It can include manipulation, gaslighting, threats, constant criticism, isolation, and other controlling behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike physical abuse, emotional abuse can be subtle and long-lasting—often making survivors question whether what they’re experiencing is “bad enough” to count. But it is. Abuse is abuse.

<button class="collapsible">My Experience with Emotional Abuse</button>
<div class="content">
      <p><strong>Emotional abuse doesn’t always leave visible scars — but it leaves lasting damage.</strong> It reshapes how you see yourself, how you trust others, and how safe you feel in your own skin.</p>

      <p><strong>From Family</strong><br>
      It started early. My own family taught me to hide my emotions, to be the strong one, to stay quiet even when I was hurting. When I expressed pain, I was “too sensitive.” When I had needs, I was “too much.” I was made to feel like a burden — like I had to earn love, and even then, it could be taken away at any moment.</p>

      <p><strong>From Bullies</strong><br>
      School wasn’t safe either. I was picked apart by bullies who saw my differences and used them as ammo. They mocked my health, my past, my appearance — anything they could. Those voices followed me long after school ended. And the worst part? Eventually, I started believing them.</p>

      <p><strong>From Relationships</strong><br>
      In my relationships, the abuse wore a different mask. It looked like love at first. Then it looked like control, jealousy, manipulation. I was told what I could wear. I was kept from friends. I was gaslit until I questioned my own reality. I was made to feel crazy for needing support.</p>

      <p>Some of them sexualized me in humiliating ways — accusing me of things I hadn’t done, twisting innocent moments. I felt violated without ever being touched. I lost my sense of safety in my own body.</p>

      <p><strong>But I’m Still Here</strong><br>
      Emotional abuse doesn’t end when the person walks away. It echoes. It sticks. But so does healing. I’ve had to unlearn everything I was taught about love and worth. I’ve had to relearn how to trust myself, how to speak up, and how to believe that I deserve more.</p>

      <p>If you’re in it — if you’ve been hurt by family, bullied in school, or broken down in a relationship — I want you to know:<br>
      It’s not your fault. You are not “too much.” You are enough. And what happened to you was abuse, even if no one ever hit you.</p>

      <p>You deserve to be safe. You deserve to be heard. And you deserve to heal on your own terms.</p>
