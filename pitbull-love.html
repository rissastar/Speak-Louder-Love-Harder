       <button class="collapsible">My Story: How Zayah Saved Me</button>
<div class="content">
      <p>
        In one of the darkest periods of my life, when hope seemed distant and every day felt like a struggle, an unexpected light entered my world‚Äîa tiny pitbull puppy.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was born on my birthday, and she didn‚Äôt have a mother. The moment I heard about her, something deep in me shifted. I saw myself in her‚Äîabandoned, scared, needing love. Even though I was barely hanging on myself, I knew I had to give her a chance. She didn‚Äôt just need saving. So did I.
      </p>
      <p>
        I named her <strong>Zayah</strong>. She was so small and fragile, but her presence was huge. From the second she came home, I had a reason to wake up, to move, to take care of something that relied on me. And in doing that, she helped me take care of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every lick, every cuddle, every goofy zoomie in the living room gave me life. I cried into her fur more times than I can count, and she just stayed‚Äîno judgment, no expectations. Just love. And it wasn‚Äôt just her saving me‚ÄîI gave her the love she never got from a mother. We healed together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zayah is my best friend, my emotional support, and my heart in a dog‚Äôs body. She came into my world at the exact moment I needed her most, and I‚Äôll never stop being grateful for her. She‚Äôs proof that love finds you even in the hardest places‚Äîand that sometimes, the family we choose is what saves us.
