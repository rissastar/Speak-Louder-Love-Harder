      <h2>Understanding Trauma</h2>
      <p>Trauma is an emotional response to a deeply distressing or disturbing event that overwhelms your ability to cope. It can happen after experiencing or witnessing events like abuse, neglect, violence, loss, or disasters.</p>
      
      <p>Trauma doesn’t have to stem from a single event—it can be cumulative, chronic, and even hidden beneath the surface. Each person’s response is unique.</p>
